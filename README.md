# Change it!
Change it! is an application where users can trade its products that they no longer want instead of sales them for money. Users can login and create its products so that other users can do a match if they are interested in doing a barter. This app was part of the second project of the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack. Its development lasted ten days. The technologies used in this app include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, MongoDB and Node.js.

This project was developed in colaboration with [Santiago Trigo](https://github.com/trigoporres)
